So far, I have assisted my supervisors in several lectures and seminars, primarily in the course <i>Elements of Machine Learning and Data Science</i> during 2023, 2024 and 2025. This introductory lecture is designed to help bachelor’s students build a solid foundation in machine learning methods and data science.  In addition to this, I co-organised a seminar on multi-objective optimisation in 2023 and I am currently co-organising a practical lab on AI in Games.
</p>
<p>
I am supervising both bachelor’s and master’s theses. If you are interested in writing a thesis under my supervision, please feel free to reach out! For more details and information about current thesis opportunities, please visit our chair's <a href="https://www.aim.rwth-aachen.de/thesis.html"> website </a>.
