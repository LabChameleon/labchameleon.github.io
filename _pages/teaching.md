So far, I have assisted my supervisors in several lectures and seminars, primarily in the course <i>Elements of Machine Learning and Data Science</i> during 2023 and 2024. 
This introductory lecture is designed to help bachelor’s students build a solid foundation in machine learning methods and data science. 
In addition to this, I co-organised a seminar on multi-objective optimisation in 2023.
</p>
<p>
I am also supervising both bachelor’s and master’s theses. 
If you are interested in writing a thesis under my supervision, please feel free to reach out!
I especially welcome students who already have their own ideas or topics they are interested about exploring! For more details and information about current thesis opportunities, please visit our chair's <a href="https://www.aim.rwth-aachen.de/thesis.html"> website </a>.
