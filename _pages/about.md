I’m a PhD student at RWTH Aachen University, working on Automated Machine Learning for Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Holger Hoos. My research focuses on increasing the practical applicability of Reinforcement Learning by automating the many design decisions required to create effective policies.

With my research I want to bridge foundational research in Reinforcement Learning with the practical advances already developed in the Automated Machine Learning community. Ultimately, I hope this work will transform Reinforcement Learning into more of an engineering discipline, moving away from its reputation as a ‘black box.’

Before my PhD, I worked on fine-tuning large speech recognition systems for low-resource languages. I’m very curious about applying Reinforcement Learning to large foundational models as well to enhance their capabilities beyond text and speech.

Besides my research, I enjoy exploring some of the more philosophical questions related to the development of intelligence. I’m particularly fascinated by how biological brains evolved to be so powerful, and how we’re attempting to replicate their abilities through artificial, mostly very different, methods.
