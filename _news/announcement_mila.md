I have been awarded a nine-month scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and will be joining MILA in Montreal as an incoming student starting in September. I will be working in Professor Castroâ€™s lab on the dependencies between RL hyperparameters and environment properties. Super excited to go!
